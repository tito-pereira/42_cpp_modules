This is 42's introduction to Object Oriented Programming and to the C++ language.
Like every single other 42 project, it had several goals in mind:
- practice of basic C++ new syntax, operators, data types and classes;
- incomplete instructions to promote self learning and error solving;
- familiarity with Makefile and C++ compilers;
- 
- good code practice for scalability and performance;
- etc;

These exercises were made while studying in 42 Porto as part of the Computer Science
Common Core curriculum. They were done according to the C++98 standard.
