/*
If your implementation is correct, executing the following code will print:
. an attack with "crude spiked club"
. then a second attack with "some other type of club" for both test cases

In which case do you think it would be best to use a pointer to
Weapon? And a reference to Weapon? Why? Think about it before
starting this exercise.
